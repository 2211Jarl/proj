# EDA FOR UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING
This is regarding a project I have done for my internship at sparks foundation.
I go into detail about the libraries and dataset I use for this project and find the optimum number of clusters needed to use K-Means clustering (unsupervised Machine Learning)
Thank you.
